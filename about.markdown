Hello world,

welcome to my project blog.  
Here, I will be publishing the work and research on projects I am doing privately. Electronics is going to be the main topic, but generally speaking, it will cover the projects I&#8217;m spending my time on.  

The long-term goal here is to build up a project archive so that the ideas can eventually be useful to others.  
So stay tuned for the first project to be published.
